Hey, Im Nate, and this is a blog about tech, working in support, and the weird world of figuring shit out when you're the one people call (and scream at) for help.

## Who Am I?

Hey, I'm Nate (they/them).

I'm a tech support worker in a call center, mostly doing L1 work — that means I'm usually the first person someone talks to when their stuff breaks. I also mess around with Linux, tinker with my Steam Deck, and spend a lot of time googling problems no one else seems to write about.

I'm neurodivergent, which definitely colors how I approach tech — and how tech sometimes doesn't play nice in return. So if you ever feel like the usual advice doesn't quite work for your brain? Yeah, same.

## What This Blog Is (and Isn't)

This blog **is**:

- A collection of simple, useful tech tips that actually work  
- A way to help others in the trenches of tech  

This blog **isn't**:

- Corporate SEO shit
- AI Generated, Assisted or anything, **FUCK** AI 
- Polished, looking for something fancy? This won't be it.

## Why I’m Doing This

I've been there — juggling tickets, repeating the same fix for the millionth time, looking up error codes that make me go WTF, just *how*. 

I started this blog because:
- I wanted to **help others** who are doing the same job and need real answers  
- Most tech advice out there is buried in SEO nonsense and 40-paragraph intros  
- There's not enough **relatable, casual** content out there for L1 support and tech workers  
- I needed a place to rant, share, and write the stuff I wish I had when I was starting out

## What You’ll Find Here

- Tips and tricks for tech support
- Personal stories from working in call centers and L1 tech  - 
  **DUE TO NDA'S ALL NAMES AND MOST PII WILL BE CHAGED OR STRIPPED DOWN** 
- Workarounds, and command line tips ticks and hacks
- Rants, reality checks, and some hopefully helpful advice
