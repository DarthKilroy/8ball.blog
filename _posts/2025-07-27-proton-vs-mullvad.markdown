Both Promise great privacy and a good product, but who is better? 

I tried both and these are my honest thoughts. 

(Proton is better)

I was **NOT** Paid in any way to write this and there are **0** commission links on this page, no promo codes and no kickback for me. 

Okay, lets dive in. 

## Mullvad - https://mullvad.net
---


Pros: 
1. Cheap
	1. at running at just €5 (~$5.87) a month flat. 
	2. There is no "if you buy 2 years at a time each month is 4.50€"
2. Privacy 
	1. When you sign up, you get an account number like this (2826628920354832), and thats the only thing you have to ID your account, no username or password. Though that also means that if you lose that, your locked out of your account for good. 
	2. They Claim to have a very strict no logs policy, you can read more here - https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy and their privacy policy https://mullvad.net/en/help/privacy-policy
	3. You can also pay with cash if you want. 
3. Simple
	1. This is a very very simple UI for Mullvad, you just hit connect and thats it. 

Cons: 
1. Reliability 
	1. I have had multiple times where my VPN just disconnects and kicks me offline (kill switch enabled), now I have not really dug into it that much but happens quite a bit. 
2. No Port Forwarding
	1. Makes it harder to sail the 7 Seas. 
	2. Also wouldn't allow you to host a Game or something behind it. 
3. Speed 
	1. I had major major speed issues with Mullvad that I just didn't have with Proton. 
4. Easy to lose access to account
	1. This was something I touched above, if you loose that super long random string of numbers, your toast, done. So make sure you save it someplace safe, and not on a sticky note on your desk (or on a public blog for everyone to read)
5. Not a lot of servers to choose from and not a lot of countries ether. 

## ProtonVPN - https://protonvpn.com
---


Pros:
1. Speed 
	1. I found ProtonVPN to be a lot faster for me, about a 100-250Mbps difference (tested from speedtest.net from the same country)
2. Reliability
	1. I have had 1 or 2 disconnects from Proton the entire time I have been using them (over 2 years)
3. Port Forwarding
4. Simple UI but more options 
	1. The UI is also super simple just point and click and it will connect to you to the nearest VPN server for your location, you can also easy choose the default server when you quick connect. 
5. Privacy, like Mullvad, Proton Claims to have a no logging Policy - https://protonvpn.com/support/no-logs-vpn/ and their Privacy policy - https://protonvpn.com/privacy-policy

Cons: 
1. Expensive
	1. Running at €9.99/month for VPN Plus (just the VPN) and €12.99/month for Proton Unlimited (all Proton Features) if you buy per month 
	2. if you do the 2 year plan its €4.49/month for VPN plus (€107.76/2 years) and €7.99/Mo for the Proton Unlimited (€191.76/2 Years) 
2. Need an account to sign up. 
	1. This is something that I love about Mullvad is that you just get an account number and thats all you have to ID you with is that number, wish more companies would do that, but with Proton you need to sign up for an account and verify your email (you can sign up for a free proton email though). 

## Results

I personally like Proton a bit better just b/c it fits my use case and my day to day usage better then Mullvad. 

Though, I still really like Mullvad, and I would Recommend them to anyone who needs a Secure Private VPN that they don't want to give out any info for.  

So for me personally, Proton is the winner *but* I still highly recommend Mullvad if you want. 

Though please look at both, and pick for what works best for you.
