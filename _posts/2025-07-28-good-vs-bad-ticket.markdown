Tickets. If you work in IT, you can’t escape them. They’re the lifeblood of support — or the reason you question your career on a daily basis.

But what *actually* makes the difference between a solid, helpful ticket… and a mess that makes you want to launch your headset into space?

## What Makes a **Good** Ticket

### A Clear Description  
> “User can't connect to the network after returning from lunch. Other users nearby are fine. Already tried restarting.”

Beautiful. You gave context, narrowed it down, and even did basic troubleshooting. Thank you! 
Go into detail, you cannot put enough detail into a ticket. 

### Real Contact Info  
- Name spelled right. Seriously, *double check.* Ask them how to spell it if you're not sure.  
- Extension or callback number. Read it back to make sure it's correct.  
- Full Address if applicable to your line of work

### Steps to Reproduce
> “Crashes when opening Outlook and trying to send an attachment.”

Doesn’t need to be perfect. Even a pattern or vague timeline helps us get to the root of the problem faster than "uhhh... it just stopped working."

### Error Codes  
Please. I’m begging you. If there’s an error message, **copy it word-for-word**.

The code might mean nothing to the user, but to you and me, it tells us exactly whats going on.

## What Makes a **Mess** of a Ticket

### “Help”  as the entire ticket 
Just that. One word.  
Cool, do you need emotional support? A fire extinguisher? A therapist? Give us *something.*

### No Description  
> “User reports issue.”

Okay. What issue? Who? Where? Is it their mouse, their monitor, or their soul that’s broken?

### “It Was Working Yesterday”  
This one *can* be helpful — as background gives us a start to when it stopped working, but by itself, it's about as useful as "it rained last week."  

Tell us *what* isn’t working *now* and we’ll take it from there.

## Why this matters

We’re not asking for essays, please don't give us a book to read either. Just give us enough info so we don’t have to channel our inner mind reader.

**A Good ticket:**
- Gets solved faster  
- Cuts down on the back-and-forth  
- Makes *you* look competent  
- Saves everyone’s stress levels

**A bad ticket:**
- Slows everything down  
- Makes us chase people for basic info  
- Can literally get ignored until someone escalates it with yelling (ive seen this happened and ive been the one yelled at b/c a telco didn't want to touch a mess of a ticket)
