As someone in the Tech space, I hear about (and use) a VPN daily (in fact im daily driving one right now as a follow up to my Proton VS Mullvad).

There is a good chance that you have as well, heck you might have even seen the ads for one (*Cough Cough NordVPN*).

## What Even *Is* a VPN?

VPN stands for **Virtual Private Network**. It creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet, hiding your actual IP address and encrypting the stuff you’re doing online, kind of, ill explain a bit more.

## Why You Should Be Using One

### 1. **You're on Public Wi-Fi**
Coffee shops, hotels, airports — all prime targets for “man-in-the-middle” attacks, and some public networks MITM (Man in the Middle) you themselves. 

### 2. **Your ISP Doesn’t Need to Know Everything**
In a lot of places (especially the U.S.), your Internet Service Provider is legally allowed to sell your browsing data. A VPN makes that data mostly useless to them.

### 3. **You Like Having Options**
VPNs let you change your IP's Location.  That means access to region-locked content, bypassing censorship, and sometimes even better prices on stuff like flights or software.

## Okay, But Are There Downsides?

Yeah, a few — but they’re manageable.

- **Slower Speeds**: You’re routing traffic through a another server. You should not Expect to get amazing speeds on your VPN, no matter who it is. 
- **Not All VPNs Are Trustworthy**: If it’s “free,” **you’re the product**. *Pay for a reputable one*, or you’re just handing your traffic to another sketchy party.
- **It’s Not a Magic Cloak**: A VPN hides your IP, not your identity. If you log into your Google account, it still knows it’s you.

## Some Facts about VPN's 

- **THEY CANNOT PREVENT YOU FROM BEING HACKED**
They can help by changing your IP address, but if you click on a weird link or download malware, thats on you. 
 A VPN is not a magic bullet that makes you 100% anonymous online, you also need to be smart about your online activities/actions. 
 
 Just a reminder:  Whatever VPN you use, the company behind the service *will* have access to your real IP address and all your traffic, you are routing it all though *their* server. This is why it's important to choose a VPN that has a strict no-logs policy, and a company you trust. 

- **THEY DO NOT ENCRYPT EVERYTHING**
This is how a VPN works:
**YOU** <- *encrypted* -> **VPN SERVER** <- *unencrypted* -> **INTERNET** 
You to the VPN form a secure tunnel Between you and the VPN server, they really don't encrypt anything beyond that. 

- Free VPN's are **NOT SECURE** 
A good VPN network costs a lot to run, and a company has to make money some way, if you are not paying with money, you are paying with your data. 


## Wrap up
Find a VPN that you like, from a company you trust, *pay for it* try it out for a few months before deciding if you want to stick with it or not. 

Stay Safe, and Stay Smart.
